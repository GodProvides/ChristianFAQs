  <h1>About God Provides</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm Vincent, and I started this project to answer questions about God, share messages, and help people grow spiritually. Here you can find videos, debates, and a place to ask questions freely.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>About 2 years ago, I felt a calling to do missionary work. Although I can't travel right now, I can talk to people about Jesus, and that’s my intention. Here, I will try my best to answer questions. I'm not a professional at this, so if I don't answer your question, it's because I don't want to say something I think is true but is actually wrong and misleading to others. I want to ensure that what I'm saying is real and backed by evidence, so it might take me a while to respond. God Bless, and remember that GOD PROVIDES!</p>
